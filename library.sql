These subgroups contain one or more individual SEO factors with a specific weight or importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violations, while a group unto themselves, are displayed under the group and subgroup to which they&rsquo;re associated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2017/06/2017-SEL_SEO_Periodic_Table_condensed.png\" style=\"height:1296px; width:800px\" /><br />\r\nThose two-letter acronyms you see on the chart above? That&rsquo;s our play on the periodic table of elements and the letter representations, or symbol, of each element. You may have had to remember that the symbol for gold was Au or that iron&rsquo;s was Fe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/seotable\">Periodic Table of SEO</a>, we&rsquo;ve tried to make it slightly more intuitive. The first letter of each &ldquo;SEO element&rdquo; comes from the subgroup that it&rsquo;s in, and the second letter stands for the individual factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SEO factors work in combination</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No single SEO factor will guarantee search engine rankings. Having a great HTML title won&rsquo;t help if a page has low-quality content. Having many links won&rsquo;t help if they are all low in quality. Having several positive factors can increase the odds of success, while the presence of negative factors can worsen those odds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>On-the-page success factors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On-the-page search ranking factors are those that are almost entirely within the publisher&rsquo;s own control. What type of content do you publish? Are you providing important HTML clues that help search engines (and users) determine relevancy? How does your site architecture help or hinder search engines?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Off-the-page success factors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Off-the-page ranking factors are those that publishers do not directly control. Search engines use these because they learned early on that relying on publisher-controlled signals alone didn&rsquo;t always yield the best results. For instance, some publishers may try to make themselves seem more relevant than they are in reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With billions of web pages to sort through, looking only at &ldquo;on-the-page&rdquo; clues isn&rsquo;t enough. More signals are needed to return the best pages for any particular search.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SEO violations &amp; ranking penalties</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Make no mistake &mdash; search engines want people to perform SEO because it can help improve their search results. Search engines provide help in the form of guidelines, blog posts and videos to encourage specific SEO techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there are some techniques that search engines deem &ldquo;spam&rdquo; or &ldquo;black hat,&rdquo; which could result in your pages receiving a ranking penalty, or worse, being banned from the search engines entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violations are generally tactics meant to deceive or manipulate a search engine&rsquo;s understanding of a site&rsquo;s true relevancy and authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Weighting of search ranking factors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All the factors we show are weighted on a scale of 1 to 3, as shown in the top right corner of each factor, as well as reflected in the hue of that factor. A weighting of 3 is most important and is something you should pay special attention to because it has a bigger impact than other factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that factors weighted 2 or 1 aren&rsquo;t important; they are. It&rsquo;s just that they are of less importance, relatively speaking, in terms of the other factors on the chart. Violations are also weighted, but in negative numbers, with -3 being the worst and potentially most harmful to your SEO success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weighting is based on a combination of what search engines have said, surveys of the SEO community and our own expertise and experience in watching the space over time. We don&rsquo;t expect them to be perfect. Not everyone will agree. Your mileage may vary. But we&rsquo;re confident it is a useful general guide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&lsquo;Missing&rsquo; SEO factors &amp; the Guide&rsquo;s philosophy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Experienced SEOs may be wondering why some factors aren&rsquo;t shown. How come ALT text and bolding words aren&rsquo;t included as HTML factors, for example?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer? We don&rsquo;t think those things are as important, relatively speaking. We&rsquo;re not trying to encompass every possible signal (<a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/schmidt-listing-googles-200-ranking-factors-would-reveal-business-secrets-51065\">Google has over 200 of them</a>) and sub-signals (<a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/bing-10000-ranking-signals-google-55473\">Google has over 10,000 of those</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the goal of the Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors and this online companion guide is to help those new to SEO focus on the big picture and perhaps allow experienced SEOs to hit the &ldquo;reset&rdquo; button if they&rsquo;ve gotten lost staring at specific trees in the SEO forest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why this SEO guide doesn&rsquo;t address having your most important keywords at the beginning or end of an HTML title tag. Nor are we trying to assess how much more weight an H1 header tag carries than an H2 tag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re purposely avoiding being ultra-specific because such things often distract and pull us down the rabbit hole. Instead, we hope you gain an understanding that pages should have descriptive titles, that indicating page structure with header tags may help, and topping things off with structured data is a good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do these things well, and you&rsquo;ve probably addressed 90 percent of the most important HTML factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, it&rsquo;s not whether a good reputation on Twitter is worth more than on Facebook. Instead, we&rsquo;re trying to help people understand that having social accounts that are reputable in general, which attract a good following and generate social shares, may ultimately help you achieve search success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Want more specifics about success factors?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We know some of you may want to drill down into specifics. In that case, the Moz Search Engine Ranking Factors&nbsp;<a href=\"https://moz.com/search-ranking-factors\">survey</a>&nbsp;is worth a look. Every two years, hundreds of well-regarded SEOs are asked to determine the importance of specific ranking factors. We do hope you&rsquo;ll keep any specific ranking factors in the context of the fundamentals covered by our table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, many of the success factors aren&rsquo;t true algorithmic factors at all. Content Research (element Cr) is a highly weighted &ldquo;on-the-page&rdquo; factor that describes the process of researching the words people use to find your content. Understanding your user is important to your SEO success, even if it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;ranking&rdquo; factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also check out our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo\">What Is SEO/Search Engine Optimization?</a>&nbsp;page, which lists some useful guides to the fundamentals (including one from Google itself) along with many more SEO resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the guide you&rsquo;re reading now is a great resource for understanding key SEO factors.

As headlines have exposed the troubling inner workings of company after company, startup culture no longer feels like fodder for gentle parodies about ping pong and hoodies. It feels ugly and rotten. Facebook, the greatest startup success story of this era, isn&rsquo;t a merry band of hackers building cutesy tools that allow you to digitally Poke your friends. It&rsquo;s a powerful and potentially sinister collector of personal data, a propaganda partner to government censors, and an enabler of discriminatory advertising.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m reminded of a particular Mitchell and Webb skit:&nbsp;<em>&quot;Are we the baddies?&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the topic of unanticipated downsides to technology, there is no show more essential than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888\">Black Mirror</a>. If you haven&#39;t watched Black Mirror yet, do not pass go, do not collect $200, go immediately to Netflix and watch it. Go on! Go ahead!</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>? Fair warning: please DO NOT start with season 1 episode 1 of Black Mirror! Start with season 3, and go forward. If you like those, dip into season 2 and the just-released season 4, then the rest. But humor me and please at least watch the first episode of season 3.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The technology described in Black Mirror can be fanciful at times, but several episodes portray disturbingly plausible scenarios with&nbsp;<em>today&#39;s</em>&nbsp;science and tech, much less what we&#39;ll have 20 to 50 years from now. These are very real cautionary tales, and some of this stuff is well on its way toward being realized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Programmers don&#39;t think of themselves as people with the power to change the world. Most programmers I know, including myself, grew up as nerds, geeks, social outcasts. Did I ever tell you about the time I wrote a self-destructing Apple // boot disk program to let a girl in middle school know that I liked her? I was (and still am) a terrible programmer, but oh man did I ever test the heck out of&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;code before copying on to her school floppy disc. But I digress. What do you do when you wake up one day and software&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;kind of eaten the world, and&nbsp;<strong>it is no longer clear if software is in fact an unambiguously good thing, like we thought, like everyone told us &hellip; like we&nbsp;<em>wanted it to be?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Months ago I submitted a brief interview for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1465462333/?tag=codihorr-20\">children&#39;s book about coding</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1465462333/?tag=codihorr-20\"><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/9780241285060.jpg\" style=\"width:400px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently recieved a complimentary copy of the book in the mail. I paged to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/dk-findout-coding-page-50.jpg\">my short interview</a>, alongside the very cool&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.prottsman.com/\">Kiki Prottsman</a>. I had no real recollection of the interview questions after the months of lead time it takes to print a physical book, but reading the printed page, I suddenly hit myself over the head with the very answer I had been searching my soul for these past 6 months:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/dk-findout-coding-page-50.jpg\"><img alt=\"Jeff Atwood quote: what do you love most about coding?\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/dk-findout-coding-page-50-quote.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In attempting to simplify my answers for an audience of kids, I had concisely articulated the one thing that keeps me coming back to software:&nbsp;<strong>to serve man</strong>. Not on a platter, for bullshit monetization &ndash; but software that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-just-in-time-theory/\">helps people</a>&nbsp;be the best version of themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And you know why I do it? I need that help, too. I get tired, angry, upset, emotional, cranky, irritable, frustrated and I need to be reminded from time to time to choose to be the better version of myself. I don&#39;t always succeed. But&nbsp;<em>I want to</em>. And I believe everyone else &ndash; for some reasonable statistical value of everyone else &ndash; fundamentally does, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the not-so-secret design philosophy behind Stack Overflow, that&nbsp;<strong>by helping others become better programmers, you too would become a better programmer</strong>. It&#39;s unavoidable. And, even better, if we leave enough helpful breadcrumbs behind for those that follow us,&nbsp;<em>we collectively advance the whole of programming for everyone</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I apologize for not blogging much in 2017. I&#39;ve certainly been busy with Discourse which is actually going great; we grew to 21 people and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2017/12/discourse-gives-back-2017/\">gave $55,000 back</a>&nbsp;this year to the open source ecosystem we build on. But that&#39;s no excuse. The truth is that it&#39;s been hard to write because this has been a deeply troubling year in so many dimensions &mdash; for men, for tech, for American democracy. I&#39;m ashamed of much that happened, and I think one of the first and most important steps we can take is to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-hugging-will-continue-until-morale-improves/\">embrace explicit codes of conduct</a>&nbsp;throughout our industry. I also continue to believe, if we start to think more holistically about what our software can do to&nbsp;<strong>serve all people</strong>, not just ourselves personally (or, even worse, the company we work for) &mdash; that software can and should be part of the solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to amplify on these thoughts in recent podcasts:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/kim-crayton.jpg\" style=\"height:100px; width:100px\" /></td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kimcrayton.com/commengreport-jeff-atwood/\">Community Engineering Report</a>&nbsp;with Kim Crayton</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/dave-rael.jpg\" style=\"height:100px; width:100px\" /></td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-258-jeff-atwood-sharing-the-house\">Developer on Fire</a>&nbsp;with Dave Rael</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/william-channer.jpg\" style=\"height:100px; width:100px\" /></td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drt.fm/jeff-atwood\">Dorm Room Tycoon</a>&nbsp;with William Channer</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Software is easy to change, but people ... aren&#39;t. So in the new year, as software developers, let&#39;s make a resolution to focus on the part we&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;change, and keep asking ourselves one very important question:&nbsp;<strong>how can our software help people become the best version of themselves?</strong></p>\r\n', 'aglie2.jpg', '2018-02-04 10:06:07'),

Video games are probably&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ablog.codinghorror.com+%22video+games%22\">the single thing most attributable to my career as a programmer</a>, and everything else I&#39;ve done professionally after that. I still feel video games are one of the best ways to learn and teach programming,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/heres-the-programming-game-you-never-asked-for/\">if properly scoped</a>, and furthermore I take&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/level-one-the-intro-stage/\">many cues from video games in building software</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would characterize my state of mind for the last six to eight months as &hellip;&nbsp;<em>poor</em>. Not only because of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/\">current events in the United States</a>, though the neverending barrage of bad news weighs heavily on me, and I continue to be profoundly disturbed by the erosion of core values that I thought most of us stood for as Americans. Didn&#39;t we used to look out for each other, care about each other, and fight to protect those that can&#39;t protect themselves?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In times like these, I sometimes turn to video games for escapist entertainment. One game in particular caught my attention because of its meteoric rise in player count over the last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://steamcharts.com/app/578080\"><img alt=\"pubg-steam-stats-nov-2017\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/pubg-steam-stats-nov-2017.png\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That game is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/\">Player Unknown&#39;s Battlegrounds</a>. I was increasingly curious why it was so popular, and kept getting more popular every month. Calling it a mere phenomenon seems like underselling it; something truly unprecedented is happening here. I finally broke down and bought a copy for $30 in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"player-unknown-battleground\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/player-unknown-battleground.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few hours in, I had major flashbacks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-gamification/\">the first time I played Counter-Strike in 1998</a>. I realized that&nbsp;<strong>we are witnessing the birth of an entirely new genre of game: the Battle Royale</strong>. I absolutely believe that huge numbers of people will still be playing some form of this game 20 years from now, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/stats/\"><img alt=\"steam-top-games-by-player-count-nov-2017\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/steam-top-games-by-player-count-nov-2017.png\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve seen&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(film)\">the Japanese movie</a>, and it&#39;s true that there were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game\">a few Battle Royale games</a>before PUBG, but this is clearly the defining moment and game for the genre, the one that sets a precedent for everyone else to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s hard to explain why Battlegrounds is so compelling, but let&#39;s start with the loneliness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although you can play in squads (and I recommend it), the purest original form of the game is 100 players, last man standing. You begin with nothing but the clothes on your back, in a cargo aircraft, flying over an unknown island in a random trajectory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"battlegrounds-cargo-plane\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/battlegrounds-cargo-plane.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s up to you to decide when to drop, and where to land on this huge island, full of incredibly detailed cities, buildings and houses &ndash; but strangely devoid of all life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"playerunknown-battleground-drop\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/playerunknown-battleground-drop.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happened to everyone? Where did they go? The sense of apocalypse is overwhelming. It&#39;s you versus the world, but where did the rest of the world go? You&#39;ll wander this vast deserted island, scavenging for weapons and armor in near complete silence. You&#39;ll hear nothing but the wind blowing and the occasional buzzing of flies. But then, suddenly the jarring pak-pak-pak of gunfire off in the distance, reminding you that other people are here. And they aren&#39;t your friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"battle-royale-vista\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/battle-royale-vista.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>the dread of never knowing when another of the 100 players on this enormous island is going to suddenly appear around a corner or over a hill is&nbsp;<em>intense</em>. You&#39;ll find yourself wearing headphones, cranking the volume, constantly on edge listening for the implied threat of footfalls. Wait, did I hear someone just now, or was that me? You clench, and wait. I&#39;ve had so many visceral panic moments playing this game, to the point that I had to stop playing just to calm down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"pubg-combat\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/pubg-combat.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PUBG is, in its way, the scariest zombie movie I&#39;ve ever seen, though it lacks a single zombie. It dispenses with the pretense of a story, so you can realize much sooner that the zombies, as terrible as they may be, are nowhere as dangerous to you as your fellow man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwile, that huge cargo airplane still roars overhead every so often, impassive, indifferent, occasionally dropping supply crates with high powered items to fight over. Airstrikes randomly target areas circled in red on the map, masking footfalls, and forcing movement while raining arbitrary death and terror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"pubg-map\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/pubg-map.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the island is huge and you can land anywhere, after a few minutes a random circle is overlaid on the map, and a slowly moving wall of deadly energy starts closing in on that circle. Stay outside that circle at your peril; if you find yourself far on the opposite side of the map from a circle, you better start hunting for a vehicle or boat (they&#39;re present, but rare) quickly. These terrordome areas are always shrinking, always impending, in an ever narrowing cone, forcing the remaining survivors closer and closer together. The circles get tighter and deadlier and quicker as the game progresses, ratcheting up the tension and conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually the circle becomes so small that it&#39;s impossible for the handful of remaining survivors to avoid contact, and one person,&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;out of the hundred that originally dropped out of the cargo plane, emerges as the winner. I&#39;ve never won solo, but I have won squad, and even finishing first out of 25 squads is an unreal, euphoric experience. The odds are so incredibly against you from the outset, plus you quickly discover that 85% of the game is straight up chance: someone happens to roll up behind you, a sniper gets the drop on you, or you get caught in the open with few options. Wrong place, wrong time, game over. Sucks to be you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"pubg-vehicle-shooting\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/pubg-vehicle-shooting.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You definitely learn to be careful, but there&#39;s only so careful you can be. Death comes quickly, without warning, and often at random. What else can you expect from a game mode where there are 100 players but only 1 eventual winner?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There haven&#39;t been many Battle Royale games, so this game mode is a relatively new phenomenon. If you&#39;d like to give it a try for free,&nbsp;<strong>I highly recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/\">Fortnite&#39;s Battle Royale mode</a>&nbsp;which is 100% free, a near-clone of PUBG, and quite good in its own right.</strong>&nbsp;They added their Battle Royale mode well after the fact; the core single player &quot;save the world&quot; gameplay of building stuff and fighting zombie hordes is quite fun too, though a bit shallow. It also has what is, in my opinion, some of the most outstanding visual style I&#39;ve ever seen in a game &ndash; a cool, hyperbolic cartoon mix of Chuck Jones, Sam &amp; Max, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. It&#39;s also delightfully diverse in its character models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/\"><img alt=\"fortnite-battle-royale\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/fortnite-battle-royale.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The only things you&#39;ll give up over PUBG are the realistic art style, vehicles, and going prone. But the superb structure building system in Fortnite&nbsp;<em>almost</em>&nbsp;makes up for that. If nothing else it is a demonstration of how incredibly compelling the Battle Royale game mode is, because that part of the game is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/fortnite/fortnite-battle-royale-player-numbers\">wildly successful</a>&nbsp;in a a way that the core game, uh, wasn&#39;t. Also it&#39;s free!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#39;t intend for this to happen, but to me,&nbsp;<strong>the Battle Royale game mode perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the current moment</strong>, and matches my current state of mind to a disturbing degree. It&#39;s an absolutely terrifying experience of every human for themselves, winner takes all, with impossible odds. There are moments it can be thrilling, even inspiring, but mostly it&#39;s brutal and unforgiving. To succeed you need to be exceedingly cautious, highly skilled, and just plain&nbsp;<em>lucky</em>. Roll the dice again, but know that everyone will run towards the sound of gunfire in hopes of picking off survivors and looting their corpses. Including you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Battle Royale is not the game mode we wanted, it&#39;s not the game mode we needed, it&#39;s the game mode we all&nbsp;<em>deserve</em>. And the best part is, when we&#39;re done playing, we can turn it off.</p>\r\n', 'segue-blog-software-methodology.png', '2018-02-04 10:07:55');

Cookies are usually stored as hashes, rather than the actual cookie value, so having the hash doesn&#39;t let you impersonate the target user. Furthermore, most modern web frameworks rapidly cycle cookies, so they are only valid for a brief 10 to 15 minute window anyway.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Email addresses</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Although users have reason to be concerned about their emails being exposed, very few people treat their email address as anything particularly precious these days.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>All posts and topic content</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Let&#39;s assume for the sake of argument that this is a fully public site and nobody was posting anything particularly sensitive there.

If we were, that&#39;s a whole other blog post I can write at a later date.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Password hashes</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>What&#39;s left is&nbsp;<strong>the password hashes</strong>. And that&#39;s &hellip;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/speed-hashing/\">a serious problem indeed</a>.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the attacker has your database, they can crack your password hashes with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-password-is-too-damn-short/\">large scale offline attacks</a>, using the full resources of any cloud they can afford. And once they&#39;ve cracked a particular password hash,&nbsp;<strong>they can log in as that user &hellip; forever</strong>. Or at least until that user changes their password.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>?? That&#39;s why, if you know (or even suspect!) your database was exposed, the very first thing you should do is reset everyone&#39;s password.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Discourse database password hashes\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/06/discourse-db-password-hashes.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what if you&nbsp;<em>don&#39;t</em>&nbsp;know? Should you preemptively reset everyone&#39;s password every 30 days, like the world&#39;s worst bigco IT departments? That&#39;s downright user hostile, and leads to serious pathologies of its own. The reality is that you probably&nbsp;<em>won&#39;t</em>&nbsp;know when your database has been exposed, at least not until it&#39;s too late to do anything about it. So it&#39;s crucial to slow the attackers down, to give yourself time to deal with it and respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, the only real protection you can offer your users is just how resistant to attack your stored password hashes are. There are two factors that go into password hash strength:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>The hashing algorithm</strong>. As slow as possible, and ideally designed to be&nbsp;<em>especially</em>slow on GPUs for reasons that will become painfully obvious about 5 paragraphs from now.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>The work factor</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>number of iterations</strong>. Set this as high as possible, without opening yourself up to a possible denial of service attack.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve seen guidance that said you should set the overall work factor high enough that hashing a password takes at least 8ms on the target platform. It turns out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://samsaffron.com/\">Sam Saffron</a>, one of my Discourse co-founders, made a good call back in 2013 when he selected the NIST recommendation of&nbsp;<strong>PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>64k iterations</strong>. We measured, and that indeed takes roughly 8ms using our existing Ruby login code on our current (fairly high end, Skylake 4.0 Ghz) servers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that was 4 years ago. Exactly how secure are our password hashes in the database today? Or 4 years from now, or 10 years from now? We&#39;re building open source software for the long haul, and we need to be sure we are making reasonable decisions that protect everyone. So in the spirit of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/designing-for-evil/\">designing for evil</a>, it&#39;s time to put on our Darth Helmet and play the bad guy &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>let&#39;s crack our own hashes!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/06/dark-helmet.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re gonna use the biggest, baddest single GPU out there at the moment,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/epixoip/a83d38f412b4737e99bbef804a270c40#gistcomment-2060753\">the GTX 1080 Ti</a>. As a point of reference, for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 the 1080 achieves 1180 kH/s, whereas the 1080 Ti achieves 1640 kH/s. In a&nbsp;<em>single</em>&nbsp;video card generation the attack hash rate has increased nearly 40 percent. Ponder that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, a tiny hello world test to see if things are working. I downloaded&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hashcat.net/hashcat/\">hashcat</a>. I logged into our demo at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://try.discourse.org/\">try.discourse.org</a>&nbsp;and created a new account with the password&nbsp;<code>0234567890</code>; I checked the database, and this generated the following values in the hash and salt database columns for that new user:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>hash<br />\r\n<code>93LlpbKZKficWfV9jjQNOSp39MT0pDPtYx7/gBLl5jw=</code><br />\r\nsalt<br />\r\n<code>ZWVhZWQ4YjZmODU4Mzc0M2E2ZDRlNjBkNjY3YzE2ODA=</code></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Hashcat requires the following input file format: one line per hash, with the hash type, number of iterations, salt and hash (base64 encoded) separated by colons:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>type   iter  salt                                         hash\r\nsha256:64000:ZWVhZWQ4YjZmODU4Mzc0M2E2ZDRlNjBkNjY3YzE2ODA=:93LlpbKZKficWfV9jjQNOSp39MT0pDPtYx7/gBLl5jw=\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s hashcat it up and see if it works:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>./h64 -a 3 -m 10900 .\\one-hash.txt 0234567?d?d?d</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that this is an intentionally tiny amount of work, it&#39;s only guessing three digits. And sure enough, we cracked it fast! See the password there on the end? We got it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>sha256:64000:ZWVhZWQ4YjZmODU4Mzc0M2E2ZDRlNjBkNjY3YzE2ODA=:93LlpbKZKficWfV9jjQNOSp39MT0pDPtYx7/gBLl5jw=:0234567890</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we know it works, let&#39;s get down to business. But we&#39;ll start easy. How long does it take to brute force attack&nbsp;<strong>the easiest possible Discourse password, 8 numbers</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; that&#39;s &quot;only&quot; 108&nbsp;combinations, a little over one hundred million.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>Hash.Type........: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256\r\nTime.Estimated...: Fri Jun 02 00:15:37 2017 (1 hour, 0 mins)\r\nGuess.Mask.......: ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d [8]\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with a top of the line GPU that&#39;s &hellip; OK, I guess.

And I have more bad news for you: Discourse hasn&#39;t allowed 8 character passwords for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-password-is-too-damn-short/\">quite some time now</a>.

But what if we divided the number by&nbsp;<strong>eight</strong>&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/epixoip/a83d38f412b4737e99bbef804a270c40\">by putting eight video cards in a single machine?</a>&nbsp;That&#39;s well within the reach of a small business budget or a wealthy individual. Unfortunately, dividing 38 months by 8 isn&#39;t such a dramatic reduction in the time to attack. Instead, let&#39;s talk about nation state attacks where they have the budget to throw&nbsp;<em>thousands</em>&nbsp;of these GPUs at the problem (1.1 days), maybe even&nbsp;<em>tens of thousands</em>&nbsp;(2.7 hours), then &hellip; yes. Even allowing for 10 character password minimums, you are in serious trouble at that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/06/8-gpu-cracking-rig.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we want Discourse to be nation state attack resistant, clearly we&#39;ll need to do better. Hashcat has a handy benchmark mode, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iwoMR5TBYAZ5eiSphkIQfIEfbrVvWW_tKwS4L1cYlaI/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true\">here&#39;s a sorted list of the strongest (slowest) hashes that Hashcat knows about</a>&nbsp;benchmarked on a rig with 8 Nvidia GTX 1080 GPUs. Of the things I recognize on that list,&nbsp;<strong>bcrypt</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>scrypt</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512</strong>&nbsp;stand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My quick hashcat results gave me some confidence that we weren&#39;t doing anything terribly wrong with the Discourse password hashes stored in the database. But I wanted to be&nbsp;<em>completely sure</em>, so I hired someone with a background in security and penetration testing to, under a signed NDA, try cracking the password hashes of two live and very popular Discourse sites&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discourse.org/customers\">we currently host</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I was provided two sets of password hashes from two different Discourse communities, containing 5,909 and 6,088 hashes respectively. Both used the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 algorithm with a work factor of 64k. Using hashcat, my Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPU generated these hashes at a rate of ~27,000/sec.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common to all discourse communities are various password requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>All users must have a minimum password length of 10 characters.</li>\r\n	<li>All administrators must have a minimum password length of 15 characters.</li>\r\n	<li>Users cannot use any password matching a blacklist of the 10,000 most commonly used passwords.</li>\r\n	<li>Users can choose to create a username and password or use various third party authentication mechanisms (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc). If this option is selected, a secure random 32 character password is autogenerated. It is not possible to know whether any given password is human entered, or autogenerated.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Using common password lists and masks, I cracked 39 of the 11,997 hashes in about three weeks, 25 from the ???????? community and 14 from the ???????? community.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a security researcher who commonly runs these kinds of audits, so all of the attacks used&nbsp;<strong>wordlists</strong>, along with known effective patterns and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack\">masks</a>&nbsp;derived from the researcher&#39;s previous password cracking experience, instead of raw brute force. That recovered the following passwords (and one duplicate):</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><code>007007bond</code><br />\r\n			<code>123password</code><br />\r\n			<code>1qaz2wsx3e</code><br />\r\n			<code>A3eilm2s2y</code><br />\r\n			<code>Alexander12</code><br />\r\n			<code>alexander18</code><br />\r\n			<code>belladonna2</code><br />\r\n			<code>Charlie123</code><br />\r\n			<code>Chocolate1</code><br />\r\n			<code>christopher8</code><br />\r\n			<code>Elizabeth1</code><br />\r\n			<code>Enterprise01</code><br />\r\n			<code>Freedom123</code><br />\r\n			<code>greengrass123</code><br />\r\n			<code>hellothere01</code><br />\r\n			<code>I123456789</code><br />\r\n			<code>Iamawesome</code><br />\r\n			<code>khristopher</code><br />\r\n			<code>l1ghthouse</code></td>\r\n			<td><code>l3tm3innow</code><br />\r\n			<code>Neversaynever</code><br />\r\n			<code>password1235</code><br />\r\n			<code>pittsburgh1</code><br />\r\n			<code>Playstation2</code><br />\r\n			<code>Playstation3</code><br />\r\n			<code>Qwerty1234</code><br />\r\n			<code>Qwertyuiop1</code><br />\r\n			<code>qwertyuiop1234567890</code><br />\r\n			<code>Spartan117</code><br />\r\n			<code>springfield0</code><br />\r\n			<code>Starcraft2</code><br />\r\n			<code>strawberry1</code><br />\r\n			<code>Summertime</code><br />\r\n			<code>Testing123</code><br />\r\n			<code>testing1234</code><br />\r\n			<code>thecakeisalie02</code><br />\r\n			<code>Thirteen13</code><br />\r\n			<code>Welcome123</code></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>If we multiply this effort by 8, and double the amount of time allowed, it&#39;s conceivable that a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;motivated attacker, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-youtube-are-fueling-the-next-frontier-of-password-cracking/\">one with a sophisticated set of wordlists and masks</a>, could eventually recover 39 &times; 16 = 624 passwords, or about&nbsp;<strong>five percent</strong>&nbsp;of the total users. That&#39;s reasonable, but higher than I would like. We absolutely plan to add a hash type table in future versions of Discourse, so we can switch to an even more secure (read:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pxdojo.net/2015/08/what-i-learned-from-cracking-4000.html\">much slower</a>) password hashing scheme in the next year or two.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)\r\n  20273 H/s\r\n\r\nscrypt\r\n  886.5 kH/s\r\n\r\nPBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512\r\n  542.6 kH/s \r\n\r\nPBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256\r\n 1646.7 kH/s \r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>After this exercise, I now have a much deeper understanding of our worst case security scenario, a database compromise combined with a professional offline password hashing attack. I can also more confidently recommend and stand behind our engineering work in making Discourse secure for everyone. So if, like me, you&#39;re not entirely sure you are doing things securely, it&#39;s time to put those assumptions to the test.

The ride-hailing space was the single largest recipient of investor dollars, with several rivals in the space raising billions. Investors also poured copious sums into&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.crunchbase.com/news/coworking-popular-vcs-already-chosen-favorite-spot/\" target=\"_blank\">co-working</a>, consumer internet and augmented reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chart-1.png?w=661&amp;h=680\" style=\"height:680px; width:661px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newcomers also joined the unicorn club for the first time in 2017, albeit at a slightly slower pace than the preceding two years. For all of 2017, 60 new startups were added to the unicorn list. This compares to 66 newly minted unicorns in 2016 and the record-setting 2015 with 99 newcomers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below, we break down the leading locations for new and existing unicorns, top sectors for investment capital, exits and a few other trends affecting the space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Geographic breakdown</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of unicorns are headquartered in either the U.S. or China, and that&rsquo;s also the case for newcomers to the Unicorn Leaderboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, both the U.S. and China continued to mint new unicorns at a steady clip. A total of 29 U.S. companies inked their first funding round at a valuation of a billion dollars or more, up from 22 the prior year. In China, 24 new unicorns joined the leaderboard, down from 32 in 2016. Europe and Southeast Asia, meanwhile, also contributed a few unicorns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the chart below, we look at new entrants, categorized by country:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chart-2.png?w=680&amp;h=599\" style=\"height:599px; width:680px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/new-unicorns-in-2017/f5dafe04-0421-4121-8408-8c4cf213c372/identifiers?new=false\" target=\"_blank\">newcomers</a>&nbsp;were a pretty diverse bunch, spanning industries from agtech to enterprise software, including no-cost stock buying platform&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.crunchbase.com/news/robinhood-brings-free-coinbases-1b-party/\" target=\"_blank\">Robinhood</a>, online education provider VIPKID and cryptocurrency buying and selling platform Coinbase.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sectors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Unicorn investors showed a particularly strong appetite, however, for companies in a handful of sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ridesharing, in particular, had a strong funding year, with companies in the space taking more than 10 percent of all unicorn investment. That was largely attributable to billion and multi-billion dollar rounds for Lyft, Grab, Ola and Didi Chuxing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bike-sharing was also big. Two new entrants onto the unicorn list came from that space:<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ofo\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Ofo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mobike\" target=\"_blank\">Mobike</a>. However, concerns arose later in the year over whether consumer demand could support the ballooning bike supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other recipients of really substantial funding rounds, even by unicorn standards, include U.S. co-working giant&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.crunchbase.com/news/wework-puts-cash-work-build-expansive-expensive-vision/\" target=\"_blank\">WeWork</a>&nbsp;and China-based consumer internet players&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/toutiao\" target=\"_blank\">Toutiao</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/koubei\" target=\"_blank\">Koubei</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chart-3.png?w=680&amp;h=479\" style=\"height:479px; width:680px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Exiting the board</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So a lot of unicorns are raising big rounds. But is there any sign members of the group will eventually produce returns for investors?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, 2017 provided some modestly positive news for unicorn exit watchers. Fifteen venture-funded companies with private valuations of a billion dollars or more went public last year, more than double 2016 levels and the highest total since Crunchbase began tracking the asset class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acquisition activity, meanwhile, was weaker. There were just seven recorded M&amp;A exits involving unicorns in 2017, down from 10 in 2016. AppDynamics was the highest-performing exit at 95 percent over its last private valuation. For the remaining companies that exited, all appear to have been below or at their last private valuation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the chart below, we look at IPO and M&amp;A counts for unicorns over the past seven years:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chart-4.png?w=680&amp;h=647\" style=\"height:647px; width:680px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unicorn IPOs weren&rsquo;t just more common in 2017. Performance was often quite good, too. Many of last year&rsquo;s newly public companies sustained market caps far higher than their last private valuations. Top performers by this metric include several China-based unicorns, led by investment manager&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qufenqi\" target=\"_blank\">Qudian</a>&nbsp;and search engine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sogou\" target=\"_blank\">Sogou</a>. Other standouts include gaming hardware provider<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/razer\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Razer</a>&nbsp; and app developer software provider&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mulesoft\" target=\"_blank\">MuleSoft</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the chart below, we look at some of the top performers based on the post-IPO percentage gains over their last private valuations:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chart-5.png?w=680&amp;h=618\" style=\"height:618px; width:680px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lately, going public seems to be a better option for investor returns. If the company goes out below its last private valuation, that multiple can improve if it grows its market and public shareholders boost the stock. For an M&amp;A transaction, the price is set and either late-stage investors have built in protections or are losing money at those exit prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Averages point to more exits ahead</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For the 45 unicorn companies that have gone public, the average time to go public has been 26 months after first being valued at $1 billion. For the 25 companies that have been acquired, the average time to get acquired is 24 months after first being valued at $1 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does that say about the current crop of still-private companies? Because more than 150 companies out of 263 have been on the Unicorn Leaderboard for more than two years, we expect exits to increase, given the backlog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Special thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/steven-rossi\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Rossi</a>&nbsp;who manages the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/unicorn-leaderboard/\" target=\"_blank\">Crunchbase Unicorn Leaderboard</a>.</em></p>\r\n', 'unicorn_1.png', '2018-02-04 10:10:38'),

It became clear why&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/25/will-the-end-of-uber-in-london-make-women-more-or-less-safe\">Uber had been never considered the safest service for women</a>&nbsp;&ndash; because its workplace wasn&rsquo;t either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there were more tech companies led by women, I truly believe it would change the way women are treated in society &ndash; in part as a result of the values shown in their company&rsquo;s services or products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Valerie Stark, co-founder and CEO of friendship and dating app Huggle</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/blog/2017/oct/12/gender-parity-women-tech-equality-workforce#img-3\"><img alt=\"Jessica Naziri\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e555a6e3f2053eae950d49dcad9a80c7bb69ee3/0_124_667_400/master/667.jpg?w=300&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7a7909fba6a6e435db0ddd3434eea558\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcareers%2Fblog%2F2017%2Foct%2F12%2Fgender-parity-women-tech-equality-workforce%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-3%23img-3&amp;picture=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F4e555a6e3f2053eae950d49dcad9a80c7bb69ee3%2F0_124_667_400%2F667.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Would%20tech%20be%20different%20if%20women%20made%20up%20half%20the%20workforce%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcareers%2Fblog%2F2017%2Foct%2F12%2Fgender-parity-women-tech-equality-workforce%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-3%23img-3\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Would%20tech%20be%20different%20if%20women%20made%20up%20half%20the%20workforce%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcareers%2Fblog%2F2017%2Foct%2F12%2Fgender-parity-women-tech-equality-workforce%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Aimg-3%23img-3&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F4e555a6e3f2053eae950d49dcad9a80c7bb69ee3%2F0_124_667_400%2F667.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;The tech world would benefit from work titles free of gender,&rsquo; says Jessica Naziri. Photograph: Jessica Naziri</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&lsquo;The tech industry would produce better products for women (which aren&rsquo;t just covered in pink)&rsquo;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With greater equality, the tech world would benefit from both work titles free of gender and diverse perspectives &ndash; it would produce better products designed and marketed to women (which are not just covered in pink). It would also mean a better world &ndash; more diverse voices would mean products and services that work for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a woman in tech, I am already swimming upstream when it comes to respect in the field. Whether I&rsquo;m on a panel with only men, writing an email, or being featured in a news spot, I don&rsquo;t want to be known as &ldquo;the female founder of TechSesh.co&rdquo; &ndash; I just want to be the founder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want my accomplishments to be attributed to my gender. I can manage, lead and create just as easily when leaving gender out of my job title. My work speaks for itself &ndash; as it should. Titles like &ldquo;#Girlboss&rdquo; actually diminish the power of women. We use this label to describe female bosses based on their gender instead of the job they are doing. You wouldn&rsquo;t slap a religious or racial description onto a job title, so why is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-girlboss-bossbabe-have-got-to-go_us_579ea2a0e4b00e7e269fceae\">designating someone a girlboss</a>&nbsp;or a mumpreneur ever okay?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we do achieve gender parity in tech, it will create more opportunities to design technology for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Jessica Naziri, founder of TechSesh.co, a platform dedicated to empowering women in tech</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/blog/2017/oct/12/gender-parity-women-tech-equality-workforce#img-4\"><img alt=\"Anne Marie\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6383793321c3c23e619b20d2a2470501a946186d/0_59_2192_1315/master/2192.jpg?w=300&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=fa4e022342ba80d2c9e43df1c926f5ec\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcareers%2Fblog%2F2017%2Foct%2F12%2Fgender-parity-women-tech-equality-workforce%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-4%23img-4&amp;picture=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F6383793321c3c23e619b20d2a2470501a946186d%2F0_59_2192_1315%2F2192.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Would%20tech%20be%20different%20if%20women%20made%20up%20half%20the%20workforce%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcareers%2Fblog%2F2017%2Foct%2F12%2Fgender-parity-women-tech-equality-workforce%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw%26page%3Dwith%3Aimg-4%23img-4\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Would%20tech%20be%20different%20if%20women%20made%20up%20half%20the%20workforce%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcareers%2Fblog%2F2017%2Foct%2F12%2Fgender-parity-women-tech-equality-workforce%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Aimg-4%23img-4&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F6383793321c3c23e619b20d2a2470501a946186d%2F0_59_2192_1315%2F2192.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;If we had more women in the tech world, we&rsquo;d have a lot more products that actually solved problems for everyone,&rsquo; says Anne-Marie Imafidon.

When you have different types of people on medical trials, either on the funding side or doing the research, it means&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/the-male-contraceptive-pill-bring-it-on\">research is less biased</a>. So, for example, I believe that if men had periods we&rsquo;d have a lot more advancement in sanitary towels, tampons and pain relief technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments\">Surveys show</a>&nbsp;that in the volume and nature of trolling women are attacked more than men, so they are more aware of these issues. I believe if women were in charge of tech companies, there would be more protection put in place for cyberbullying and trolling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Anne-Marie Imafidon, co-founder of Stemettes, a social enterprise encouraging girls towards Stem roles</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Looking for a job?
